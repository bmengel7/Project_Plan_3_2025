# Project_Plan_3_2025

Overview- Using serial killer dataset from Kaggle to show information on serial killers and their crimes. Focus is TBD, planning on pulling it all together and then narrowing down who and how I want to focus. 

•	Collect Data Sets- Kaggle- Excel- Multiple Sets to pull from

•	Decide how difficult of a project to make.

•	Data Set- Serial Killers from Kaggle (make sure to give credit to where you got the data from)

•	Determine HOW I want to display data. Do I want to focus more on the actual crime, the gender, the locations? Leaning towards location and focus on victims and then on the criminals. Is there a way to avoid     
    giving the criminal more attention than they have already received.
    
•	Focus on a combo of mostly SQL and tableau- that is your new employment goal. Make sure to add in some python, a generally easy queries as it’s not your specialty or interest. 

•	Start adding gitbash updates and commits as soon as possible. Must have 10- make sure they are significant.
